# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
#### My solution for Kaggle competition “House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques” , where you should predict the final price of residental homes in Ames. (<i>Link for competition is presented below</i>)

## Description
<br> It's one of my first Kaggle competions and I created Kaggle notebook (kernel) to explain all my actions with data. I also added table of content, where you can find description of dataset, EDA, data preprocessing, modeling and evaluation. In the process of exploratory data analysis, I visualized the percentages of gaps for each feature, filled missing values, visualized the distribution of target variable and after I used log transformation for it. I also explored the relationship between the target variable and categorical, quantitative features. The gradient boosting algorithm XGRegressor from XGBoost was chosen as a model for solving the competition. In addition, I paid attention to tuning model during training. 
<br>RMSE = 0.15287 </br>
